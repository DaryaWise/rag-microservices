Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated Earth for more than 160 million years, from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous period. They lived on every continent, ranging from chicken-sized runners to towering giants like sauropods. Some walked on two legs, others on four; some were swift hunters with sharp teeth and claws, while many were peaceful plant-eaters with long necks or armored plates.

Not all dinosaurs looked the same, and many were more bird-like than lizard-like. A growing body of fossils shows feathers or feather-like coverings on several species, especially among theropods—the group that includes famous names like Velociraptor. In fact, most scientists agree that modern birds are living dinosaurs, the last surviving branch of the dinosaur family tree.

Dinosaurs vanished in a mass extinction about 66 million years ago, likely triggered by a large asteroid impact combined with volcanic activity and climate change. Yet their story continues through the rocks they left behind. Paleontologists study bones, footprints, and even fossilized eggs to learn how dinosaurs grew, hunted, nested, and migrated. Each new discovery adds detail to a vivid picture of ancient ecosystems—and reminds us how life on Earth can change dramatically over deep time.
